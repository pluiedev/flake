Y'know, I used to like GitHub. 
I've started using it in... 2016?
Damn! I'm a genuine ten-year veteran now!
But honestly, I've been pretty disappointed recently.
So disappointed, that I chose to seek my fortune elsewhere.

Not out of any moral, ethical, ideological or dogmatic reasons —
those were already well-enunciated enough by many of my peers —
but out of sheer pragmatism, that GitHub simply does not offer a
stable, high-quality, enjoyable experience for me and many others alike.

My exodus from GitHub is because I realized that, between all the
big wigs barking about how they will "hard pivot" into providing a
quality AI platform, they have completely lost the ability to run
a good code hosting service.

Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that developing AI is
necessarily contradictory with providing a good service — au contraire.
AI is only the *symptom*. A quality service should not have to resort
to increase its surface value with techno-optimist-sounding catchphrases,
corporate laconisms, and general trendcatching. No. A quality service
is a **trendsetter**, something that shows the entire industry how it
*should* and *ought* to be done.

When I first joined GitHub, it *was* that trendsetter. It is the way
how code *should* to be hosted, and it defined how online open-source
collaboration of the decade *ought* be conducted. Every modern Git forge
in existence that has a pull request-like feature owes their fundamental
design to GitHub. Somewhere in the process, that status is lost.
Their ability of operating a reliable and enjoyable service, gone down
in the drain with it.

GitHub's focus on AI is not the core problem. It is just the sign that
their core business is no longer competitive. GitHub had not introduced a
fundamental new feature and hasn't shaped the future of OSS collaboration
since the Year of Our Lord Twenty Eighteen, while its countless competitors
have drawn from it and learned from its shortcomings and pitfalls.

It is time for all of us to pack up our bags and seek greener pastures.
Newer forges with newer ideas are exploiting the lacuna left by GitHub's
own incompetence. Yes, it will be slightly annoying to migrate away from
the mindset that "GitHub has it all" — but isn't the beauty of OSS,
that everyone can make their own choice?
